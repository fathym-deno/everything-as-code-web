# Getting Started with Everything as Code

This guide will walk you through the steps to start using Everything as Code (EaC).

## Step 1: Sign Up or Sign In to Fathym

To use EaC, you first need to have a Fathym account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](/dashboard). If you already have an account, you can sign in [here](/dashboard).

## Step 2: Generate a New API Security Token

After signing in, you need to generate a new API security token. This token will be used to authenticate your requests to the EaC API. To generate a new token, follow these steps:

1. Go to the API Tokens [page](/dashboard/jwt).
2. Click on the "Generate New Token" button.
3. Give your token a name and click "Generate".

Remember to keep your token secure and do not share it with anyone, it will only appear once.

## Step 3: Configure the EaC Modules

EaC is modular, meaning you can choose which parts of it you want to use. To configure the modules, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Modules [page](/dashboard/modules).
2. Select the modules you want to use.
3. Configure any custom modules.
4. Click "Save".

## Step 4: Start Managing Your Products and Code

With the modules configured, you can now start using EaC to manage your products and code. Refer to the specific documentation for each module to learn how to use them.

## Step 5: Customize EaC

EaC is highly customizable. You can create custom modules for your EaC or re-configure the existing modules to meet your needs. To learn more about customizing EaC, refer to the Customization Guide.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the official documentation.
